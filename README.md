# Esp energy monitor - Version 2
Esp32 based module, 220V ac powered, energy monitor with three ct sensors (for solar power, home power and air conditioning power), and an LCD I2C display for visualization. Integrated with ESPhome in my IoT house based in Home Assistant.
Any possibility of improvement is accepted.

### Added
This is an update of the previous [version](https://github.com/zioCristia/esp-energy-monitor-v1) where I added a third sensor for reading the consumption of air conditioners and the possibility of adding additional boards for future ideas. A compatible board to add smart garden irrigation functionality is coming soon.

The board's design also allows it to be inserted into the rail of the home's breaker box by printing a 3D component.

### The rest will come soon, in the meantime you can look at the old [version](https://github.com/zioCristia/esp-energy-monitor-v1) of this board.
